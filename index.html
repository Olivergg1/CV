          <p>Volvo Hackathon Winter 2022</p>
          <p class="description">
            Working for 2 days, groups were to solve a given problem. The
            approach to the problem(s) was to be determined by the group. My
            group decided to develop an interactive app for Microsoft HoloLens
            2, using Unity. After the given time-limit was exceeded, the
            solution was presented for the other groups and a jury.

          <p>Volvo IT Summer intern</p>
          <p class="description">
            Summer intern at Volvo IT in Sk√∂vde during the summer of 2023. 
            Worked in a team of 5 interns, within the responsible team of ordinary employees. 
            Our task through out the summer was to begin the refactoration and redesign of an internal system. 
            We worked with an agil team collaboration framwork (SCRUM) where the main focus was weekly feedback, 
            planning and weekly goals. The technologies used were C#, both in frontend (Blazor + Fluxor) and backend (.NET). 
            Microsoft Azure was also used as a managment medium for backlogs and scrum planning. 
            My time at Volvo enhanced my skills in programming, practicaly but also in terms of collaboration and communication 
            within the team. It was a good oppurtunity to work with SCRUM, after only having read about it in University courses.

          <p>UNGATIO designcamp [Summer 2019]</p>
          <p class="description">
            Two weeks of designing and problem solving. A group of ten students
            from schools in √ñsterg√∂tland gathered together to solve several
            problems and request from companies such as Link√∂ping Airport,
            Mj√∂lby kommun, Hallins and more. During these weeks, visits were
            made to the different companies' facilities, where we got tours and
            had discussions with the staff, inorder to gather more close-to-life
            information and inspiration. The information gathered was then used
            to develop solutions for the different problems. After the period of
            2 weeks, staff from all companies was invited and gathered for a
            final presentation where the solutions were presented.

          <p>School project, Hot tub</p>
          <p class="description">
            In a course "Teknik 2", a project was given to my group by the
            teacher. Our group's project was to research, come up with a design
            and determine the cost of building a hot tub. We visited Hallins'
            facility where we got a tour, and different materials and approaches
            for design was discussed with the experienced staff. Other aspects
            was also discussed with other companies, such as the cost of
            operating. My main role in the group was to develop an interface/app
            for the hot tub using a Raspberry Pi.
